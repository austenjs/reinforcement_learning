## [Pong](https://github.com/austenjs/reinforcement_learning/tree/main/Pong)
Try to maximize the score of the agent against a computer in an Atari pingpong game. Trained 1000 epochs using policy gradients.<br>
The code is inspired from: Den Bekker, I (2017) Python Deep Learning Cookbook [Source code](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Python-Deep-Learning-Cookbook/blob/master/Chapter05/Chapter%205%20-%20Implementing%20policy%20gradients.ipynb).
