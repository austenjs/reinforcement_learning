Reinforcement Learning
======

This repo is dedicated for projects related to `reinforcement learning`. Most of the projects here are using toolkit from [Gym](http://gym.openai.com/).

## [Pong](https://github.com/austenjs/reinforcement_learning/tree/main/Pong)
Try to maximize the score of the agent against a computer in an Atari pingpong game. Trained 1000 epochs using policy gradients.<br>
The code is inspired from: Den Bekker, I (2017) Python Deep Learning Cookbook [Source code](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Python-Deep-Learning-Cookbook/blob/master/Chapter05/Chapter%205%20-%20Implementing%20policy%20gradients.ipynb).

## [Breakout](https://github.com/austenjs/reinforcement_learning/tree/main/Breakout)
Try to maximize the score of the agent by breaking as much blocks as possible in an Atari breakout game. Trained 200 epochs using Deep-Q learning.<br>
The code is inspired from: Den Bekker, I (2017) Python Deep Learning Cookbook [Source code](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Python-Deep-Learning-Cookbook/blob/master/Chapter05/Chapter%205%20-%20Implementing%20a%20deep%20Q-learning%20algorithm.ipynb).
